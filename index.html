          <p class="about__text">Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 - 24 November 1991)
          was a British singer-songwriter, who achieved international fame as the lead vocalist of
          the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music,
          he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. 
          Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, 
          influencing the artistic direction of Queen.</p>

          <p class="about__text">Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town in the British protectorate 
          of Zanzibar. His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were from the Parsi community of western India.
          He had a younger sister, Kashmira. Mercury spent most of his childhood in India where he 
          began taking piano lessons at the age of seven while living with relatives. At the age of 12, he 
          formed a school band, the Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists. In the spring of 1964, Mercury
           and his family fled to England from Zanzibar to escape the violence of the revolution.

          <p class="about__text">Mercury studied graphic art and design, after graduation he joined
          a series of bands.
          In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, to 
          become lead singer of their band Smile. They were joined by bassist John Deacon in 1971.
          Despite the reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial
          management, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band. And the rest is history!
